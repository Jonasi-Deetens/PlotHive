# PlotHive

## Overview

PlotHive is an innovative crowd-sourced storytelling platform designed to unite writers and readers of all levels, fostering collaborative story creation. Users participate by contributing sections to a story prompt, with the community ultimately voting for the best continuation. The winning segment is then integrated into the evolving narrative. As users engage with the platform, they accrue points and privileges, visible on their personalized dashboard. Once a story is complete, it's added to our virtual bookstore, where users can purchase final versions. Contributors receive a percentage of the profits based on their level of involvement.
