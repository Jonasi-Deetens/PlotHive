# PlotHive

## Short Summary

The project is a crowd sourced storytelling platform where it is our goal to bring writers and readers of all levels together to build stories.
Every fixed time period, the platform launches a new prompt, everyone can choose to contribute and write the next section to this prompt.
All people who have an account, can then comment and vote for their favourite version of the next section.At fixed times, the most upvoted section gets added to the story and the cycle starts again.
The platform keeps track of all the user’s contributions, likes and comments and can see these on their personalised dashboard.
When the story is finished, they get added to our ‘bookstore’ and users can buy the final versions.
Depending on how much a user contributed, they get paid a percentage of the profit.
